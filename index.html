  <h1 class="callout-title">Hello, let me introduce myself</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
      My name is Andreas Ohlsson, currently 22 years old and studying to a Master's degree in computer science at <a href="http://www.lth.se">Lunds Tekniska Högskola</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen software engineering for my master, since I like to code and to be a part of a software developing process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work part-time as an IT consultant at a student consulting company called <a href="https://www.lunicore.se">Lunicore</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I am from Lund, Sweden, and have lived in these parts for almost my whole life. 
      Computers has been my main interest for quite some time now and I started to write my own code when I was around 18 years old and have liked it ever since. I like to make desktop programs, mobile apps, webpages, as long as there is code involved I like it.

  <h2>About the page</h2>
  <p style="font-style: italic">This page is my experimental page where I keep my personal profile and practice to use css without any third party library, such as Bootstrap or Materialize. 
    Later I will also involve javascript in to this page.</p>

  <p style="font-style: italic">This page is under constant evolution, so some links might now work.</p>

  <h2>Skills</h2>
  <p class="text-container">
    During my time as student at LTH I have learned a lot of programming. But a lot of my current skills has been from
    working at Lunicore, being an IT-foreman at Västgöta Nation, and doing my own projects on my free time. 
    Below is a list of some projects that I have done or currently doing.
  </p>
  <p>

      <li>Current webpage for Västgöta Nation, it is made by using Squarespace with own customisations using css and javascript.
        It can be found <a href="https://vgnation.se">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        I was part of a team that was responsible for the webpage during Lundakarnevalen. We used wordpress as our content management system
        and created our own custome theme, therefore we wrote a lot of code consisting of php and javascript, and used html and css on top of that.
        The webpage had hundreds of thousands users during the karnevaldays and can be found <a href="https://lundakarnevalen.se/">here</a>.
      </li>
      <li>A tinder clone app built in <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/">react-native</a> and using <a href="https://firebase.google.com/">firebase</a> 
        as real-time database. It has functions like, facebook login, location services, filtering people on preferences and a chat.
        Project is currently private on Bitbucket.</li>
      <li>Currently building a whistleblowing system and a booking system for Västgöta Nation. Both are in Ruby on Rails.</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    I like to invest my spare time in different kinds of hobbies. Such as:

      <h3>Music Festivals</h3>
      <div class="bio-copy">
        <p>
          Music festivals are a big thing in my life. I've been going to a festival every summer since I was 15.
          I just love the music and the atmosphere at those places. I'm mostly there for the metal music, but I enjoy other stuff as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture of me is taken at <a href="https://bravallafestival.se">Bråvalla</a> 2017. You can see me drinking from my precious Jelzin-box that stood by me during the entire festival.

      <h3>Student Stuff</h3>
      <div class="bio-copy">
        <p>
          I am enjoying my time as a student at Lund University. I like to do student stuff, such as slipping of a fountain and dislocating my shoulder, raving on the dancefloor and then suddenly sprain my ankle in a not-so-well calculated jump, and cutting up my thumb so bad on a piece of glass that I have to seek the hospital on Valborg. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture of me is taken when I participated in <a href="https://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tandemstafetten">Tandem</a> 2017 with <a href="http://vgnation.se">Västgöta nation</a>.

      <h3>Exercising</h3>
      <div class="bio-copy">
        <p>
          I try to be active and take care of myself, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't. When I was younger I did both swimming and judo, and I eventually quit swimming and was just doing judo through my teens. When I started studying at university I had to quit judo. I still love and make time for the gym though.
        </p>
        <p>
          The picture of me is taken when I just had finished the final test and recieved my black belt in judo, roughly 17-ish years old.
