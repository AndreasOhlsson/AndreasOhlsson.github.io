  <h1 class="callout-title">Hello, let me introduce myself</h1>
  <div class="callout-copy">
    <p>
      My name is Andreas Ohlsson, currently 22 years old and studying to a Master's degree in computer science at <a href="http://www.lth.se">Lunds Tekniska Högskola</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have chosen software engineering for my master, since I like to code and to be a part of a software developing process.
    </p>
    <p>
      I currently work part-time as an IT consultant at a student consulting company called <a href="https://www.lunicore.se">Lunicore</a>.
    </p>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      I am from Lund, Sweden, and have lived in these parts for almost my whole life. 
      Computers has been my main interest for quite some time now and I started to write my own code when I was around 18 years old and have liked it ever since. I like to make desktop programs, mobile apps, webpages, as long as there is code involved I like it.

    <p>Call me <em>Ishmael</em>. Some years ago–<em>never mind how long
precisely</em>–having little or no money in my purse, and nothing
particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little
and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off
the spleen and regulating the circulation.</p>

    I like to invest my spare time in different kinds of hobbies. Such as:

          Music festivals are a big thing in my life. I've been going to a festival every summer since I was 15.
          I just love the music and the atmosphere at those places. I'm mostly there for the metal music, but I enjoy other stuff as well.

          The picture of me is taken at <a href="https://bravallafestival.se">Bråvalla</a> 2017. You can see me drinking from my precious Jelzin-box that stood by me during the entire festival.

          I am enjoying my time as a student at Lund University. I like to do student stuff, such as slipping of a fountain and dislocating my shoulder, raving on the dancefloor and then suddenly twist my ankle in a not-so-well calculated jump and cutting up my thumb so bad on a piece of glass that I have to seek the hospital on Valborg.

          I try to be active and take care of myself, sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't. When I was younger I did both swimming and judo, and I eventually quit swimming and was just doing judo through my teens. When I started studying at university I had to quit judo. I still love and make time for the gym though.

          The picture of me is taken when I just had finished the final test and recieved my black belt in judo, roughly 17-ish years old.
